My app is a recommender type app for tennis players to get string and tension recommendations. There is a large market for tennis string
and it can often be difficult to navigate for someone who simply plays the game and does not worry about equipment. The goal of this app 
is to provide a stringer, someone who strings racquets as a career, the ability to solely focus on stringing while the app gives string
recommendations that they typically would provide. This would create a more efficient system where a stringer only has to worry about
the actual physical stringing. My app also allows players to store previous string jobs found through the app in order to improve upon 
their next string job. Through a series of questions about experience level, previous injuries, target price, and preferred power level,
the user will be given a recommendation of string and tension.

To create and save a new recommendation:
1). First the user opens the app. 
2). To access the questionare, they click the button that says "Begin". 
3). The first question they will be asked is about their experience level. After selecting an answer the next question is brought up.
4). Next the user is asked if they have had previous arm injuries, either yes or no.
5). The user then picks their preferred price level.
6). The user is finally asked what power level they would like.
7). The recommendation is given on a page with two buttons.
8). Click "Add recommendation to database" in order to save the string recommendation to look back at in the future.
9). Click "Go To Homepage" to return to the homepage of the app.

To access previous string recommendations:
1). Click "View previous recommendations"
2). To return home click "Go To Homepage"

To delete previouis string recommendations:
1). Click "View previous recommendations"
2). Click on the recommendation you would like to delete
3). Click "Delete" to remove the recommendation from the database
4). Click "Go Back to Database" to return to the page with previous recommendations
